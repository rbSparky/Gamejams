# Welcome to Kaboom!

Kaboom is a JavaScript game programming library that makes game dev fast and fun.

Check out the [examples](https://kaboomjs.com/play) and [docs](https://kaboomjs.com/), or this [tutorial](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro). 

This is different from the [main kaboom template](https://replit.com/@replit/Kaboom#code/main.js):

### Pros
- simple straightforward HTML / CSS / JS
- lightweight, less files

### Cons
- no autocomplete / typescript
- no bundling / npm (can load packages with `<script>` or built-in ES6 modules)
